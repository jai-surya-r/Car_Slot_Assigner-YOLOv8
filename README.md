# Car_Slot_Assigner-YOLOv8

## Overview

This project uses YOLOv8, an object detection model, to automate parking slot assignment. It detects and labels parking slots in real-time, making parking management efficient and user-friendly. The project was trained on the PKLot dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ammarnassanalhajali/pklot-dataset?select=test), containing parking lot images in various conditions.

## Problem Statement

Parking management can be a challenge, and finding available parking slots quickly is essential. This project addresses the need for an automated system to detect and assign parking slots, reducing the time and effort required for parking.

## Key Features

- Real-time parking slot detection using YOLOv8.
- Automated parking slot assignment based on user input (car ID).
- Visual annotation of parking slot IDs on images.
- Efficient parking slot allocation for improved management.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- YOLOv8
- Gradio
- PIL (Pillow)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv8 weights or train your own.
4. Run the Gradio interface for automated parking slot assignment.

## Results

The project achieves high accuracy in parking slot detection, improving parking management efficiency. The results are summarized in the project report.

Feel free to use, modify, and contribute to make parking management smarter and more efficient!
